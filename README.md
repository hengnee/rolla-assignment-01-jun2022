Create an API in nestjs which allows users to register with a username and password.
It should assign them a unique generated ethereum address.
The user can deposit to the address and it should keep track of any ether or tokens (e.g. USDC) deposited to this address and store the details of those balances in a database, similar to an exchange.

A user should be able to do the following:
- Register an account to a database of your choice
- Get their username and deposit address
- Get their balance for ether and a specific token
